Greetings. Introductions are awkward, I don’t know what to say, aside from we’re a couple of pea's in a pod media junkies Otaku?
Essentially, we both like everything and anything Japanese. (Other than certain types of hentai….)On our site you can find anything that has to do with gaming and anime. This will not just be an ordinary website, it will be accompanied by our bad drawings, videos and community topics to get you conversing. It’s a personal platform for us to hone our skills. Wait…. If it’s a personal platform, how did you find us?
